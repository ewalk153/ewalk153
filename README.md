### Hi there 👋 I'm Eric

- 🔭 At [Shopify](https://shopify.engineering), I work on products and pricing; I've had a hand in subscriptions, checkout, product recommendations, and search
- 🌱 I recently [rebuilt a blog](https://www.chartewalk.com) to freshen up on the latest Rails 7 offerings; last year I built a 6502 computer on a breadboard
- 💬 Ask me about the differences working in a startup vs a larger fast growing company like Shopify
